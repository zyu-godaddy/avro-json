# tmp

A software system
- ingest events
- define functions over events
- order events for functions
- compute functions over ordered events

## events

inbound events -- originated at external world
that enter the system at boundaries.

outbound events -- they are merely results of some functions.
There are components monitoring emergence of these events and
sending them to external world.
In this article, such components are not considered part
of the system, but rather a companion system.
"Sending" itself is often an interesting external event
that should be ingested by the system.

internal events -- they are merely results of some intermediary functions
upon which other functions are defined.


**In the rest of the article, events only refer to inbound events**
unless qualified otherwise.


## functions


## event ordering

external order; events already ordered when ingested.

## compute
